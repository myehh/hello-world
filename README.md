# hello-world
Hi there! I’m Myeh, a student-athlete studying computer science.

💻 Current Interests: I’m still exploring different areas of computer science, but have a growing interest in machine learning and computer systems.

🌱 Learning Journey: While I’m new to using Git for personal projects, I’ve used it in class and am excited to document my future projects here.

🛠️ What’s Next?: I plan to share coding solutions, small experiments, and projects as I continue learning and finding my niche in tech.

Feel free to connect or share tips—I’m always eager to learn from others! 😊
